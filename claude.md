# Work from office and Work from home tracker

## What It Is
A calendar app that shows me, when I am supposed to work from office and when I am supposed to work from home based on the team I am part of

## Who It's For
This app is for me to stay updated on when I am expected to work from office

## Core Features (MVP)
1. Monthly calder view with days highlighting when I am expected to work from home and when I am expected to work from office
2. Holiday view on calendar based on office holiday schedule I share
3. Leave planner based on available leaves

## Nice to Have (Post-MVP)
- Recommend holidays to take based on long weekends, ideal time to take leaves, corporate understanding etc.
- Calendar integration with my google calendar

## Design Notes
- Dark theme, with minimal modern look
- Work from office color should be blue and work from home color should be green and holiday color should be purple
- Make it look like a notion app

## Technical Decisions
- Framework: React (single page)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Data: useState only (no persistence needed)

## Definition of Done
I'll consider this done when:
- [ ] It clearly shows on calender what are the days to work from office, work from home, holidays and my leave plan
- [ ] It helps me feed the yearly holidays and shows it on calendar 
- [ ] It takes my input to plan the leaves and showcase leave on calendar
